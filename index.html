          I see myself as an enthusiastic learner with enough creative
          capabilities and problem-solving inclinations and I plan to become a
          full-stack web developer in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering programming a fascinating area, one that gives you a great
          sense of accomplishment when creating components, apps, websites and
          getting stuff to work as intended, I find great joy in doing this and
          sometimes, when I code, time passes so fast that I don't even realise.
        </p>

        <h4>About my programming path:</h4>
        <p>
          It started in my early twenties (building a bunch of websites for
          small businesses in Wordpress and Joomla). Being a journalist at that
          time, among other duties, I'd also been in charge of the online
          newspaper. This is how I've learnt about the importance of search
          engine optimization, styling, customizing templates and useful
          widgets. I'm also fairly good at creating vectorial designs. Which is
          always fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been following some courses lately and just graduated from an
          industry validated coding programme. Here, I've experienced working in
          small teams, on real life projects, using HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid,
          Bootstrap), Sass, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Docker (Docker-compose), MySQL,
          Github, Webpacker, Javascript, a little bit of Jquery and DOM
          manipulation etc. We also collaborated well as a team, always talking
          and planning ideas (usually with the help of our menthors) and pushing
          our work to Github without serious issues or bug fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've studied plenty of online content about web design (including one
          of those courses from
          <em>Udemy - The Complete Web Developer in 2020 </em>, learning about
          Node.js, advanced Javascript, React, api's and so on). That never
          seems to be enough ðŸ˜€. In the meantime, I'm confident I could pick any
          new libraries/frameworks required.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I'd really want to do now is following a proper path; to work
          with a well-established environment. I'm aware that I don't have all
          those years of experience. At the moment, being highly motivated to
          have a career in programming, I'm more inclined to advance and gather
          experience than focusing on the financial aspect of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my past job experience, I usually become one of the best at what
          I do and treat everything with responsability and seriousness.
        </p>

          There's a video below where I put together a little presentation of my
          latest activity.
