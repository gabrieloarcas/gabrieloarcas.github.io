          For me programming is a fascinating area, one that gives you a great sense of accomplishment when creating
          components, apps, websites or just getting stuff to work as intended. Therefore, a few years ago I decided to
          follow a carreer as a developer (or come back to something that I've always loved).

          Being an enthusiastic learner with creative and problem-solving capabilities and working with an amazing team
          in
          a professional environment allowed me to aquire a lot of useful insights and experience in programming. I
          became
          confident that I could pick any new libraries/frameworks required and also had a glance at the
          financial world and the overall activity in an office.

        <p><strong>Aug 2021 - Sept 2020: Junior developer at Enhance Group Limited, Jersey</strong><br></p>
        <p class="indent">
          - maintained and improved their core application, Mosaic, following agile and scrum principles<br>
          - added new features or refactored and reviewed code written by other developers (React, Typescript, Ruby on
          Rails, gitHub, etc.)<br>
          - Enhance's website brand refresh (React, Ruby on Rails). See <a href="https://www.enhance.group/"
            target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a><br>
          - Enhance's blog brand refresh (HubL). See <a href="https://blog.enhance.group/blog"

        </p>

        <p><strong>2019: Graduated from Digital Jersey, an industry validated coding programme</strong><br></p>
        <p class="indent">
          - worked in small teams on real life projects, using HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid,
          Bootstrap), Sass, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Docker (Docker-compose), MySQL, Github, Webpacker, Javascript, some
          Jquery and DOM manipulation etc. We've also collaborated well as a team, always talking and planning ideas
          (usually with the help of our mentors) and pushing our work to Github without serious issues or bug fixes.
          <br><br>
          This video below contains some of the projects from that time:

        <p><strong>2008 - 2010: Freelance and other</strong></p>
        <p class="indent">
          - created a bunch of websites for small businesses by using Wordpress or Joomla.
          Being a journalist at that time, among other duties, I'd also been in charge of the online newspaper. This is
          how I learnt the importance of search engine optimization, styling, customizing templates and other
          useful widgets.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also love playing with vector designs. It's always fun and besides that I found out that sometimes I need a
          quick custom logo, navbar, animation, etc. so it's useful to at least have some basic knowledge.
          <a href="https://i.ibb.co/r4tVyt9/designs.png" target="_blank"><strong>Here</strong></a> you can see some
          attempts.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to follow a proper path, to work in a well-established environment. Being highly motivated to have
          a
          career in programming, I'm inclined to advance and gather experience, focusing less on the financial aspect of
          it. From my past job experience, I do and treat everything with responsibility and seriousness.
