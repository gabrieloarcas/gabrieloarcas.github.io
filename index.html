          Considering programming a fascinating area, one that gives you a great
          sense of accomplishment when creating components, apps, websites and
          getting stuff to work as intended, I see myself as an enthusiastic learner with creative
          capabilities and problem-solving inclinations and I really find joy in coding.
        </p>

        <h4>About my programming path:</h4>
        <p>
          It started in my early twenties (building a bunch of websites for
          small businesses in Wordpress and Joomla). Being a journalist at that
          time, among other duties, I'd also been in charge of the online
          newspaper. This is how I've learnt about the importance of search
          engine optimization, styling, customizing templates and other useful
          widgets.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been following some courses lately and just graduated from an
          industry validated coding programme. Here, I've experienced working in
          small teams, on real life projects, using HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid,
          Bootstrap), Sass, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Docker (Docker-compose), MySQL,
          Github, Webpacker, Javascript, a little bit of Jquery and DOM
          manipulation etc. We've also collaborated well as a team, always talking
          and planning ideas (usually with the help of our menthors) and pushing
          our work to Github without serious issues or bug fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've studied plenty of online content about web design (including one
          of those courses from
          <em>Udemy - The Complete Web Developer in 2020 </em>, learning about
          Node.js, advanced Javascript, React, api's and so on).
          I'm confident I could pick any
          new libraries/frameworks required. Besides that, I'm also fairly good at vector design, which is
          always fun. Therefore, I'm glad I have the ability to create my own customized logos, navbars, animations etc. 
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal, at the moment, is to follow a proper path, to work
          in a well-established environment. Being highly motivated to
          have a career in programming, I'm inclined to advance and gather
          experience, focusing less on the financial aspect of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my past job experience, I usually become one of the best at what
          I do and treat everything with responsibility and seriousness.
        </p>

          There's a video below where I put together a presentation of my
          latest activity.
